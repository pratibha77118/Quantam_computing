# Algorithm to implement division function using qiskit.
1. Import qiskit library into our program to create and run quantam program.
...
import qiskit
...
2. Create new quantum circuit with 3 qubits to provide a variety of methods for adding quantam gates and measurements to the circuits.
...
qc = qiskit.Quantum_Circuit(3)
...
3. Apply Hardamard gate to qubit 0 of the quantum circuit which is a single qubit gate that puts the qubit into an equal superposition of states |0> 
and |1>.
...
qc.h(0)
...
4. Apply Hardmard gate to qubit 1 of the quantum circuit.
...
qc.h(1)
...
5. Apply Hardmard gate to qubit 2 of the quantum circuit.
...
qc.h(2)
...
6. Apply the Controlled Xgate to qubits 1 and 2 of the quantum circuit such that it flips the target qubit if and only if the control qubit is in the state |1>.
...
qc.cx(1,2)
...
7. Apply the controlled Xgate also known as CNOT gate to qubits o and 2 of the quantum circuit qc.
...
qc.cx(0,2)
8. Measure the qubits 2,1 and 0 of the quantum circuit and store the results in classical bits 2, 1 and 0 respectively.
...
qc.measure([2,1,0],[2,1,0])
...
9. Visualize the circuit
...
qc.draw('mpl')
...
10. Test the rest in your local computer and assign job to server qunatum computer.
